    <p>Churches today keep Sunday as their sabbath, but if we look at Scripture, we see a problem.</p>

    <br />
    <p>Sunday is not the seventh day of the week, it is the first. So why do churches keep the first day of the week instead of the seventh day as a sabbath? They all have different reasons, but none of them are ever found in the Bible. And because of their own teachings or traditions, they are not keeping the fourth commandment.</p>
    <p>This is something that Yahshua rebuked the pharisees for:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mrk 7:5-9', Bold: [{From:42, To:108}, {From:325, To:398}, {From:405, To:469}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>If the church you are attending does not even keep the ten commandments, then is it really wise to assume that everything else they are teaching comes from Scripture? If they cannot get the basics right, how accurate can everything else be?</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Luk 6:46-49', Bold: [{From:0, To:64}, {From:388, To:458}, {From:570, To:597}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>If you are keeping Sunday as your sabbath then please take this to Yah in prayer, may He guide you in all truth and bless you and keep you.</p>
