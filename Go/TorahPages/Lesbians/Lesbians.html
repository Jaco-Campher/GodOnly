    <h1>Lesbians in the Bible</h1>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>It might surprise you to find that lesbians are never mentioned in Bible. The word lesbian is obviously not in the Bible, but references about women sleeping together is also not in the Bible. There are two possible exceptions to this, and we will look at both in this study.</p>
    <p class="note">I know this is a very sensitive topic, one that will get many believers very hot under the collar. So, before we start, please pray that the Holy Spirit will guide and lead you in the truth.</p>
    <p>I will also ask that you try to keep an open mind as we work through the study. If you were taught something or believed something your entire live, it can be very difficult to break free from those believes even if there is no scriptural support for it.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Torah</h2>

    <p>Let’s start with Torah, because If we are going to call something sin, we need to show where it says so in the Torah.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 18:22', Bold: [{From:0, To:3}, {From:24, To:30}, {From:41, To:49}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>
        The word
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H2145', Alt: ''}">mankind</go-strongs>
        is male and the word for
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H0802', Alt: ''}">womankind</go-strongs>
        is woman or wife. We don’t get a clear answer of whether the word “Thou” is a man or a woman, as it is part of the translation and there is no strong number for it. So, we will simply test both to be safe.
    </p>
    <p>If we replace “Thou” with man or male, it will read:</p>
    <p>“<b>A man</b> shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.”</p>
    <p>This matches with what we find in Leviticus 20.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 20:13', Strongs: [{Strong:'H0376', Meaning:''}, {Strong:'H2145', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>This clearly shows that it is a sin for two men to sleep together. But as you can see from Lev 20:13, it does not address women sleeping together.</p>
    <br />
    <p>So, let’s go back to Lev 18:22 and see what it says when we replace the word “Thou” with woman.</p>
    <p>“<b>A woman</b> shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.”</p>
    <p>Now here we run into a problem, read the first part again.</p>
    <p>“<b>A woman</b> shalt not lie with <b>mankind</b>,”</p>
    <p>This would mean that a woman cannot sleep with a man, so basically the end of humanity. This would also contradict other verses in the Bible.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 2:24', Bold: [{From:18, To:20}, {From:65, To:113}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 9:1', Bold: [{From:55, To:104}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>If we assume that “Thou” is a woman, then the verse also contradicts itself. It becomes nonsensical, saying that a woman shall not lie with a man as with a woman. Clearly the “Thou” in Lev 18:22 cannot be a woman.</p>
    <p>These are the two main verses I could find in Torah that directly talks about same sex relationships.  And as you can see, they both apply only to men sleeping together.</p>

    <h2>The First Possible Exception</h2>

    <p>In the introduction I said that there are two possible exceptions, and the first one is also found in Torah. But it is not what you might expect:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 18:18', Bold: [{From:14, To:43}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Here again as before we don’t get a clear indicator if “Thou” is a man or a woman. So again, we will test both.</p>
    <p>First, we will make “Thou” a man as before.</p>
    <p>“Neither shalt <b>a man</b> take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.”</p>
    <p>This is pretty much what you would expect, and I think the way that most people understand it.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But now look what happens when we make “Thou” a woman.</p>
    <p>“Neither shalt <b>a woman</b> take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.”</p>
    <p>Do you see it?</p>
    <p>For a woman to take a wife to her sister, we must assume that the first two women are already married.</p>
    <p>Lev 18:18 seems to work with “Thou” being a man or a woman as there is no contradictions as in Lev 18:22, other than our preconceived ideas perhaps. But what about Lev 18:22 where we saw that “Thou” can only be a man?</p>
    <p>This is sort of a catch-22 situation, if “Thou” in Leviticus 18 can only be a man, then we a back to square one and there are no laws in Torah against women sleeping together. If we assume that “Thou” can be a woman, then there is support for two women marrying each other.</p>
    <p>In either case, none of these laws would prevent women from sleeping together or marrying each other. So where does the idea come from that it is a sin?</p>
</div>

    <h2>The Second Possible Exception</h2>

    <p>This is probably the scripture that most people think of when thinking of lesbians in the Bible.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 1:26-27'}"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>On the surface it would seem that this is what we are searching for. But there are a few problems.</p>

    <h3>Adding to Torah</h3>
    <p>As shown on the landing page for Torah studies, adding to Torah is a sin.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Deu 4:2', Bold: [{From:9, To:49}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Deu 12:32', Bold: [{From:51, To:76}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Also keep in mind that Paul wrote this about 1300 years after the law was given to Moses. Does then mean that it was acceptable for women to sleep together for 1300 years, and only then did it become sin?</p>
    <p>This would contradict scripture:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Psa 19:7', Bold: [{From:0, To:29}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jas 1:17', Bold: [{From:79, To:152}] }"></go-bible-ref>

    <h3>What It Says</h3>
    <p>Secondly, if we look at the verses more closely, we will see that it does not specifically mention two women sleeping together. We just assume that it does because of what we have been taught our entire life.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 1:26', Bold: [{From:63, To:134}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Without going into any details, this can also be talking about the sexual relationship between men and women. I’m not going to do an in dept study on these two verses here as others have already done so. If you are interested in looking deeper into this, you can read another study about it here: <a href="https://www.righteouswarriors.com/controversial/article8.html" target="_blank">Biblical Polygyny (part 5): Clash of Cultures</a>.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>I know this can be hard to accept as it is the exact opposite of what we have been taught all our lives. It took me a few years to fully make peace with it after being led to it.</p>
    <p>The scary part is, that if we can be so wrong about this, what else are we still wrong about?</p>
    <br />
    <p class="note">Please note that incest laws that might have a possible overlap with this study were excluded as it was not the focus of the study.</p>
