    <h1>Nudity in the Bible</h1>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Most people today are raised with a set of standards about nudity and what is acceptable, but this can vary greatly from county to county and even culture to culture. As always, we will be looking at Torah to see if something is a sin or not.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Jn 3:4', Bold: [{From:53, To:91}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>As always before we begin with a controversial topic, please pray that the Holy Spirt will lead you in the truth.</p>
    <p>No…. don’t keep reading, pray first. 😊</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Torah</h2>

    <p>The words for naked is used six times in Torah, four times in Genesis, and two times in Exodus.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 2:25', Bold: [{From:19, To:23}, {From:57, To:72}], Strongs: [{Strong:'H6174', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Now this was before the fall, but if it was not sin before the fall, could it be a sin after the fall?</p>
    <p>Remember that the Bible says that God never changes:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jas 1:17', Bold: [{From:70, To:151}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Please keep in mind that the book of Genesis where God made Adam and Eve naked is also considered part of Torah.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Then the fall happens:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 3:6-7', Bold: [{From:305, To:309}], Strongs: [{Strong:'H5903', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 3:10-11', Bold: [{From:51, To:77}, {From:78, To:82}, {From:91, To:100}, {From:144, To:148}], Strongs: [{Strong:'H5903', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Note that none of the verses in Genesis is saying that it is a sin to be naked, just that Adam and Eve were afraid of being naked after they sinned.</p>
    <p>
        If we take a closer look at the original words used to translate the word naked, we find that both
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H6174', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        and
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H5903', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        are correctly translated as naked. Yet if we look in the context of scripture, we can see that they have very different meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H6174', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        is being naked and not ashamed. <i>(Remember this one as it will come up again later in the study)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H5903', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        is also being naked, but afraid and hiding.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Exodus has another word that is also translated as naked.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Exo 32:25', Bold: [{From:40, To:44}, {From:72, To:76}], Strongs: [{Strong:'H6544', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>But the word used for naked here is different than the other two, and if we look at the strong definition, it is not talking about physical nudity.</p>
    <p>
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H6544', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        = to loosen; by implication, to expose, dismiss; figuratively, absolve, avenge, avoid, bare, go back, let, (make) naked, set at nought, perish, refuse, uncover.
    </p>
    <p>And as with Genisis, it is not saying “thou shall not be naked”. There is no commandment given in any of these verses.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Nakedness</h2>

    <p>The word nakedness is used multiple times in Lev 18 and Lev 20, but looking at the context of these verses in Scripture, we can see that it is talking about sex or sexual relations that is not allowed and not simply being naked.</p>
    <p>
        This is not something I will cover future in this study as I believe it is pretty self-explanatory, but if you are interested,
        <a href="/Data/Documents/Nakedness in the OT.pdf" target="_blank">“Nakedness” in the Old Testament</a>
        is a 19-page study on the word nakedness that I found on the internet many years ago. This is not my own study, and I only agree 99% with what is in the study, but it is a very in dept study if you want to dig deeper.
    </p>

<div class="box">
    <h2>So where does this leave us?</h2>

    <p>As is becoming a pattern with these studies, there are no laws in the Torah about being naked. To not rely on worldly teaching and standards, we will have to look at other places in Scripture to get additional information.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Saul Prophesied Naked</h2>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Sa 19:23-24', Bold: [{From:152, To:183}, {From:233, To:240}, {From:242, To:246}], Strongs: [{Strong:'H6174', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>
        Here we see
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H6174', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        is being used again, 	naked and not ashamed. If we look at the last sentence in this passage, it will appear that it was normal for prophets to be naked.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Isaiah Commanded to Walk Naked</h2>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 20:2-4', Bold: [{From:74, To:111}, {From:150, To:171}, {From:173, To:177}, {From:250, To:255}, {From:440, To:444}, {From:498, To:516}], Strongs: [{Strong:'H6174', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Here we see that God commanded Isaiah to walk naked and barefoot, and he did so for 3 years. Would God command someone to sin?</p>
    <p>It also says that he walked naked for a sign. How effective would a sign be if no one could see it.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Simon Worked Naked</h2>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jhn 21:6-7', Bold: [{From:303, To:349}, {From:351, To:355}, {From:356, To:358}], Strongs: [{Strong:'G1131', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Notice that Yahshua says nothing about Simon working naked.</p>
    <p>If you want to dig a little deeper, Yahshua was here when Rome was ruling over Israel. Rome was known for their public baths and public toilets. Even their sport was done completely naked, and Yahshua never said anything about it, He never mentions it.</p>
    <p>And this makes sense, since God sees everyone naked anyway.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Heb 4:13', Bold: [{From:30, To:82}, {From:84, To:88}, {From:90, To:99}], Strongs: [{Strong:'G1131', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Jn 3:2', Bold: [{From:122, To:172}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Does this mean that we will also see like God sees one day? Just a thought.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Image and Likeness of God</h2>

    <p>The world teaches us that the human body is something that is sinful, or at least that seeing it uncovered is. But let’s look at what scripture says.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 1:26-27', Bold: [{From:14, To:61}, {From:251, To:354}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 9:6', Bold: [{From:60, To:94}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Col 3:10', Bold: [{From:38, To:97}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jas 3:9', Bold: [{From:79, To:110}] }"></go-bible-ref>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Temple of the Holy Spirit</h2>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 3:16', Bold: [{From:17, To:40}, {From:56, To:84}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 6:19', Bold: [{From:23, To:63}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Co 6:16', Bold: [{From:58, To:92}, {From:113, To:150}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>Would God and the Holy Spirit live in a temple that is shameful and needs to be hidden? Especially one that is made after the image and likeness of God.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Psa 139:14', Bold: [{From:29, To:84}] }"></go-bible-ref>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Lust</h2>

    <p>Lust is probably the number one argument that churches will make again nudity, and it is something that would require its own in-dept study. But to give you the short version, the idea that lust cannot be controlled is not found in the Bible. It is another worldly teaching.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Ti 1:7', Strongs: [{Strong:'G4995', Meaning:'self-control'}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>A lot of other translations translate G4995 as self-control or self-discipline.</p>
    <br />
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 58:6', Bold: [{From:41, To:99}, {From:136, To:163}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Is lust not a yoke for many today? This might be very controversial to some, but having a God honouring view of the human body is how we are set free from lust. We cannot have a God honouring view of the human body if we are afraid or ashamed of it or seeing the beauty of it.</p>
    <p>There is an entire website dedicated to this idea and how to be set free from lust, so it is not something that I will dig deeper into in this study.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://mychainsaregone.org" target="_blank">https://mychainsaregone.org</a>
    </p>
    <p>Even though I don’t agree 100% with everything on their site, this is a website that I would highly recommend for everyone, even if lust is not something you struggle with. Just go to the <b>start here</b> link on their site and go through the articles. It will change the way you see the human body, and in turn the way you see people.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Restore All Things</h2>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Act 3:20-21', Bold: [{From:96, To:139}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>This is something that would also require its own study, but if we think about it, if all things are going to be restored, then restored to what or when? The only logical option I can think of is to restore things to before the fall happened.</p>
    <p>God originally created Adam and Even naked in the garden of Eden, so what will we be wearing when go back there?</p>

</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Exclusions</h2>

    <p>Please note that nudity in relation to Poverty, War, and Prophesy / Spiritual Nakedness is not included in the study, as each topic would also require its own study:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Poverty:</b> Not have anything to wear when you need it is obviously a bad thing, but that does not make being naked a sin. Skinny dipping does not become sin because you cannot afford swimwear.</li>
        <li><b>War:</b> The rules of war and how you treat your enemies would require multiple studies, and being naked in war would be no different than being naked at any other time.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Prophesy:</b>  In prophesy, being naked is being unrighteous and being clothed represents righteousness.
            <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 19:8', Bold: [{From:42, To:62}, {From:82, To:130}] }"></go-bible-ref>
        </li>
    </ul>

</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Clarification</h2>

    <p>Just to be clear, I’m not suggesting that we start walking around naked in the world, as it is illegal in most places.</p>
    <p>Even in places where it is legal, if you feel led to take part in the nudist / naturist groups that tend to happen because of the correct view of what Yah created, and our desire to return to the beauty and freedom of the garden of Eden. Please do so carefully, as professing believers, we carry the Name of Yah in the world.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Exo 20:7', Bold: [{From:0, To:55}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>Not to say that it is something that we cannot partake in, hopefully this study has made that clear. Just do so carefully and don’t do anything that would bring disgrace to the beauty that Yah created. People in the world are already rejecting Yahshua, we cannot afford to give them more reasons to do so.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Closing</h2>

    <p>Most of us growing up was allowed to watch violence in movies or computer games, somehow it is ok for us to watch people shoot or beat each other-up or even kill each other. Yet if any form of nudity is shown, it is considered wrong or sin.</p>
    <p>In most of the world admiring the beauty of the human form has become a sin but killing and murder is accepted as entertainment.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 5:20', Bold: [{From:0, To:48}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>My hope is that this study will help to set others free from lies we have been taught by the world just like it did for me. Before being led to this by the Holy Spirit, I use to judge women on the way they dressed. Now I look at who they are, their personalities, their moral standards, and their relationship with Yah. What they wear matters very little.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 6:28-29', Bold: [{From:0, To:35}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>May Father bless you and keep you and lead in all truth.</p>
