    <h1>Do We Still Need to Keep the Law?</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>First, I must apologize if this study seems very harsh or judgmental. Please understand that this is not my intention. It is simply to show the truth according to the Bible and help set people free from false doctrines.</p>

    <h2>Is the Law Done Away With?</h2>

    <p>Most churches today teach that Yahshua has done away with the law. But let’s look at what Yahshua says in the Bible:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 5:17-19', Bold: [{From:0, To:42}, {From:62, To:85}, {From:130, To:236}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>If we then say that Yahshua has done away with the law, are we not saying that Yahshua lied?</p>
    <br />
    <p>When Yahshua was asked about eternal life, look at what He says:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Luk 10:25-28', Bold: [{From:74, To:112}, {From:133, To:158}, {From:379, To:432}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Again, Yahshua talks about the law. Now to be clear, this does not mean you can be saved by only keeping the law. Simply that the law is not done away with.</p>
    <p>We still need a saviour because none of us have kept God’s laws perfectly.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 3:22-24', Bold: [{From:9, To:62}, {From:136, To:186}, {From:235, To:269}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jhn 14:6', Bold: [{From:0, To:10}, {From:23, To:101}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Without Yahshua we would need to pay the penalty for our sins ourselves.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 5:12', Bold: [{From:11, To:35}, {From:52, To:128}] }"></go-bible-ref>

    <h2>Not Under Bondage</h2>

    <p>In the world today, everyone wants the freedom to do as they please. Just so long as we don’t hurt anyone. But that is exactly what God’s law is, the minimum set of requirements for us not to hurt one another.</p>
    <p>All of God’s laws are based in love:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 22:37-40', Bold: [{From:33, To:53}, {From:205, To:222}, {From:236, To:277}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gal 6:2', Bold: [{From:0, To:61}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gal 5:13-14', Bold: [{From:15, To:128}, {From:134, To:169}, {From:186, To:225}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>If we break one of God’s laws, someone is going to get hurt, ether immediately or somewhere down the line. If everyone on earth today kept God’s laws, theft, murder, lies, corruption, greed, etc. would not exist. We would be living in paradise.</p>

    <h2>A Question to Ponder</h2>

    <p>If sin is the transgression of God’s law:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Jn 3:4', Bold: [{From:53, To:91}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>And you do not want to keep God’s laws on earth, then why would you want to keep God’s laws in heaven?</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 22:14' }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Jn 2:3' }"></go-bible-ref>

    <p>May Father bless you and keep you and lead in all truth. (No pun intended. 😊)</p>
