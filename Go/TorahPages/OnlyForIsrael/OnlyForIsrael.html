    <h1>Only for Israel (Double Standards?)</h1>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Many believe that the law or Torah is only for the Jews and does not apply to believers in Yahshua. But are we not then saying that God has double standards? That the Jews need to keep the law to be saved but if you are a Christian then all you must do to be saved is to say I believe. This view contradicts what scripture says.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Heirs According to the Promise</h2>

    <p>The Bible shows us that both the Jews and Gentile believers are made one in Yahshua.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>If everyone is made one in Yahshua, then how can there be two different standards of what is acceptable to God and what is not?</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Double Standards</h2>

    <p>Scripture also shows us that God is not a respecter of persons, confirming what we saw above, that there can be only one standard by which everyone will be judged.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Pe 1:17', Bold: [{From:22, To:97}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>God is a God of righteousness and justice. God cannot have double standards, or God would not be just.</p>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 15:3-4', Bold: [{From:141, To:166}, {From:320, To:354}] }"></go-bible-ref>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Everyone Will be Judged</h2>

    <p>Just for in case you were wondering, yes, we will all be judged.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Psa 9:7-8', Bold: [{From:37, To:76}, {From:82, To:122}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 14:10', Bold: [{From:85, To:137}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Co 5:10', Bold: [{From:4, To:112}, {From:147, To:171}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>To be clear, there is a difference between believers and non-believers as Yahshua has already paid the price for our sins. But that does not mean there will be no punishment for believers, just that our punishment will not be eternal damnation.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jer 30:11', Bold: [ {From:0, To:47}, {From:161, To:241}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 3:13-15', Bold: [{From:0, To:68}, {From:168, To:247}, {From:249, To:334}] }"></go-bible-ref>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>God’s Laws</h2>

    <p>The law also shows us that the same law applies to everyone:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Num 15:15-16', Bold: [{From:0, To:106}, {From:152, To:202}, {From:204, To:289}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 2:11-13', Bold: [{From:13, To:42}, {From:64, To:111}, {From:134, To:177}, {From:180, To:275}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>As you can see, the law applies to everyone, and everyone will be judged by the same law. God cannot be a God of justice and have a sliding scale for what is right and wrong. There can be only one standard, and everyone must be judged by the same standard.</p>
