    <p>In today’s world everyone wants the freedom to do anything they want, just so long as they are not hurting anyone. Ironically enough, that is exactly what God’s laws are, a minimum set of laws that keeps us from hurting other people or ourselves. If you break one of God’s laws, someone is going to get hurt, either immediately or somewhere down the line.</p>
    <p>Let’s take a simple and seemingly insignificant law that most people don’t want to keep any more.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 11:7', Bold: [{From:8, To:12}, {From:91, To:110}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Deu 14:8', Bold: [{From:8, To:12}, {From:70, To:124}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Most of the time there does not seem to be any downside to eating pork. But think of where the coronavirus started. It started because of a restaurant serving pork, the very thing the Bible tells us not to eat. If the restaurant did not server pork and people did not eat pork, the coronavirus probably would not have exited or just died with the pig that it came from.</p>
    <p>One simple law that if kept could have saved countless lives and countless families from heartache.</p>
    <p>Yah gave us free will to choose for ourselves if we want to keep His ways and laws or not. But we are not free from the consequences of our choices.</p>
