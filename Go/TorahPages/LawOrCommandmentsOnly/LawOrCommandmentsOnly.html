<div class="box">
    <h2>Greatest Commandment</h2>

    <p>When Yahshua was asked what the greatest commandment is, look at what He said:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 22:36-40', Bold: [{From:21, To:48}, {From:72, To:168}, {From:244, To:283}, {From:285, To:327}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>These 2 commandments are not found in the 10 commandments, but they are found in the law.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Deu 6:5', Bold: [{From:4, To:103}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 19:18', Bold: [{From:83, To:122}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>The same is recorded in Mark, but here we see Yahshua saying that there are no greater commandments:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mrk 12:29-31', Bold: [{From:24, To:57}, {From:113, To:209}, {From:307, To:346}, {From:358, To:398}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>These 2 great commandments if you will, are not in the 10 commandments, but are summaries of the 10 commandments just like the 10 commandments are summaries of the rest of the law.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Hypocrisy</h2>

    <p>Something else to consider is things we call sin. Most believers will call it sin if 2 men are sleeping together:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 20:13', Bold: [{From:0, To:99}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>And yet this is not in the 10 commandments. If we say that we only need to keep the 10 commandments and not the rest of the law, are we not then being hypocrites for calling this sin?</p>
    <p>Or how about a brother and sister marrying each other:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 18:6', Bold: [{From:0, To:87}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Or people defrauding each other:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 19:13', Bold: [{From:0, To:35}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 19:35-36', Bold: [{From:15, To:41}, {From:47, To:54}, {From:60, To:65}, {From:74, To:80}, {From:82, To:153}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Are we then saying this is no longer sin?</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 7:7', Bold: [{From:40, To:91}, {From:127, To:142}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Jn 3:4', Bold: [ {From:53, To:91}] }"></go-bible-ref>
