        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Ask yourself, do you know something is sin because it is in scripture, or do you just believe that it is because you were taught so by the world, the church or when growing up. How do you define sin?</p>
        <p>Scripture says:</p>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Jn 3:4', Bold: [{From:53, To:91}] }"></go-bible-ref>
        <br />
        <!--<p>If you have doubts about whether we should keep the law, please see the first study below. 'Do we still need to keep the law?'</p>
        <br/>-->
        <p class="note">You will see the word Torah is used in all the studies below. Torah is the original word translated to law in the Old Testament. It is used to distinguish between the laws in the Bible and man-made laws.</p>

        <h2>Basics for Torah Study</h2>
        <p>Please keep the following in mind when doing any studies about the Torah.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Calling something sin that the Torah does not is adding to the Torah and is a sin, as in the Torah we find:</p>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Deu 4:2', Bold: [{From:9, To:15}, {From:52, To:90}] }"></go-bible-ref>

        <p>If something was acceptable to God in the past, it will still be acceptable today:</p>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Ecc 3:14', Bold: [{From:13, To:109}] }"></go-bible-ref>

        <p>God does not change:</p>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jas 1:17', Bold: [{From:79, To:151}] }"></go-bible-ref>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mal 3:6', Bold: [{From:4, To:31}] }"></go-bible-ref>
