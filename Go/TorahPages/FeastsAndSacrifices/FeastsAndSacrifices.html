    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>One of the reasons people and churches don’t want to keep the law, is because they say that we should no longer sacrifice burnt offerings. Although I agree with the view about burnt offerings, I don’t believe that is enough reason to do away with the law or the feasts.</p>

    <h2>Sacrifices</h2>

    <p>Even if we needed to keep the burnt offering or sacrifices, in Leviticus we see that this can only be done in the temple.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Deu 12:13', Bold: [{From:21, To:90}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 17:8-9', Bold: [{From:128, To:165}, {From:171, To:237}, {From:290, To:318}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Since the temple was destroyed, trying to offer burnt offerings would then be sin. But since Yahshua already paid the ultimate sacrifice for us, so we no longer need to offer burnt sacrifice.</p>

    <h2>What then About the Feasts?</h2>

    <p>The feast of trumpets is just one of the 7 feasts listed in the law, but they all require offerings and sacrifice:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 23:37', Bold: [{From:0, To:31}, {From:83, To:181}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>Further in the same passage we see that this feast must be kept forever:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 23:41', Bold: [{From:0, To:41}, {From:67, To:116}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>If Yah says that we need to keep this feast forever, but at the same time we can no longer offer burnt offerings as sacrifice, then how do we keep this commandment?</p>
    <p>We find the answer in several other places in the Bible.</p>

    <h2>Spiritual Sacrifice</h2>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jhn 4:24', Bold: [{From:1, To:15}, {From:32, To:82}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 1:11', Bold: [{From:149, To:216}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Sa 15:22', Bold: [{From:51, To:117}, {From:128, To:196}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mrk 12:33-34', Bold: [{From:4, To:115}, {From:122, To:153}, {From:159, To:208}, {From:214, To:316}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Hos 6:6', Bold: [{From:0, To:37}, {From:48, To:89}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>There are other ways to offer sacrifice.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Psa 107:22', Bold: [{From:4, To:52}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Psa 141:2', Bold: [{From:55, To:105}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 12:1', Bold: [{From:66, To:130}] }"></go-bible-ref>

    <h2>Forever</h2>

    <p>At the end of the 1000 year of peace and judgement we can see that death will be no more:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 21:1', Bold: [{From:12, To:96}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 21:4', Bold: [{From:55, To:81}, {From:151, To:187}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>We can see from this that there will need to be a change in the law as burnt offerings will not be possible anymore as there will be no more death.</p>
    <p>This is also in-line with what Yahshua said about when the law will change, when all is fulfilled:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 5:18', Bold: [{From:28, To:134}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>At this point all the prophesies in the bible will be complete and Yah will make <b>all things</b> new:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 21:5', Bold: [{From:45, To:66}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>This does not mean that the law will be done away with, just that it will be made new:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Psa 119:44', Bold: [{From:20, To:52}] }"></go-bible-ref>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>The burnt offerings needing to fall away might just be the consequence of how everything works out, but what if it is not? What if this was intentional from the beginning? What if Yah is testing our hearts?</p>
