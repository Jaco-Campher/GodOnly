            <p>All doctrines and believes must come from the Word of God. Scripture should be the sole authority on what is right and wrong.</p>

        <go-accordion params="Title: 'Bible Version'">
            <p>Even though I am not a King James (KJV) only believer, I do prefer the King James version of the bible for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is old enough to not to be influenced by today’s corruption. I am sure there was corruption when the KJV was translated as well, but hopefully less than in our modern world.</li>
                <li>It has the Strong and Lexicon data readily available.</li>
                <li>It is in the public domain. <i>(Except in England)</i></li>
            </ul>
            <p>But I do not believe that there is a single perfect translation of scripture, KJV or otherwise.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The bible used on this site is the KJV 1769 version. I did not specifically choose this version, it just checked all the requirement that was needed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is available in the <a href="https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/attributes/index.html" target="_blank">USFM</a> file format.</li>
                <li>It includes the Apocrypha.</li>
                <li>It includes Strong and Lexicon data.</li>
            </ul>

        <go-accordion params="Title: 'Other Books / Scriptures'">
            <p>To better understand, it is recommended to read the complete book of 2 Esdras. But the short version is that after the Temple was destroyed with Jerusalem, all the books in the Temple were destroyed as well. In the verses below, Ezra is asking that God sends the Holy Spirit so that the books might be preserved.</p>
            <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Es 14:21-25', Bold: [{From:285, To:311}, {From:322, To:361}] }"></go-bible-ref>
            <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Es 14:44-48', Bold: [{From:14, To:50}, {From:230, To:254}] }"></go-bible-ref>
            <p>This shows that some of the books were meant to be hidden and we also see that some of these books are meant for people living in the "latter days". In Enoch we see the same:</p>
            <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Enoch 1:2', Bold: [{From:239, To:308}] }"></go-bible-ref>
            <p>If you want to know more about some of these books, the <a href="https://www.cepher.net/" target="_blank">Cepher Publishing Group</a> has a very good <a href="https://www.cepher.net/Userfiles/Look-Inside/Preface-Millennium-Edition.pdf" target="_blank">PDF on their website</a> that gives some more details. It starts on page five if you want to skip the names section.</p>
            <p>In some of these books there are one or two verses that can seemingly contradict the Bible, but then everything else fits perfectly. Keep in mind that these books are not meant for everyone, and one way to keep them out of the Bible would be to include one or two "mistakes".</p>
