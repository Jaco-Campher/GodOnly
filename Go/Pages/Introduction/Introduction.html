    <p>This verse is kind of a double-edged sword. If you were taught the truth growing up, then it’s a good thing. But if you were ever taught anything other than the truth, then it can be very difficult to break free from the lies or even to know that what you believe is a lie.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 53:6', Bold: [{From:0, To:33}, {From:51, To:74}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>I want to turn to God’s ways and paths and live according to God’s will for my life, and I’m hoping that if you are visiting this site, that that is something you want as well. All of us have been deceived in one thing or another, and the more you study scripture, the more you realize just how much we have been deceived by many things in this world. It is only by the grace of God that we can turn back to God’s paths and will for our lives.</p>
    <p>Are you ready to put aside what you have been taught your entire life, and only look to the Word of God for what is rights and wrong, for what God’s will is for your life? Or are we going to keep clinging to the traditions of this world, and wonder why it keeps falling apart around us?</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 10:31', Bold: [{From:39, To:82}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>If you are ready to put God first in everything and seek the truth, then I pray that this site may be a help and a blessing to you on that path. But remember, you must walk the path, no one else can do it for you. Only through your own Bible studies will you find and understand.</p>

    <h2>Site Basics</h2>

    <h3>Bible</h3>
    <p>Here you can read and reference the Bible in addition to the Apocrypha and other books that some, including myself consider Scripture. These books never made it into the Bibles used by mainstream Christianity today, but some were included in other Bibles. You can find more information on the <a href="#" data-bind="click: function() { go.Navigate('/about'); }">About</a> page.</p>
    <p>Additionally, any words that match the references from the <a href="#" data-bind="click: function() { go.Navigate('/tools/legend'); }">Prophesy Legend</a> or the Strong’s list will display in the text as well. These are primarily included to better understand prophesy but can also highlight some other thing to help better understand Scripture.</p>
