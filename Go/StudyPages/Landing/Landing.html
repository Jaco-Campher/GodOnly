        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When listening to a study or sermon on a topic that you have not done your own study on, it is easy for it to make sense. By isolating a verse or even a section of a verse, you can make scripture say or mean anything. You can listen to a study now and agree with what is says. Then 6 weeks later you hear another teaching on the same topic and it can also make sense, even though it teaches something different.</p>
        <p>The only way to truly know what scripture teaches on any topic, is to do your own studies.</p>
