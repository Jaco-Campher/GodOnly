    <h2>The Question</h2>

    <p>When the Sadducees asked Yahshua about marriage in the resurrection, Yahshua said the following:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 22:29-30', Bold: [{From:108, To:165}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mrk 12:24-25', Bold: [{From:128, To:208}] }"></go-bible-ref>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Kingdom of Heaven</h2>

    <p>Yet we also see Yah being married unto us forever.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jer 3:14', Bold: [{From:50, To:70}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Hos 2:19-20', Bold: [{From:11, To:39}, {From:11, To:30}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>The kingdom of heaven is also compared to marriage.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 22:1-2', Bold: [{From:71, To:88}, {From:131, To:139}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 25:1', Bold: [{From:15, To:32}, {From:113, To:123}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>And again, we see that the kingdom of Yah will also be forever.</p>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Pe 1:11', Bold: [{From:68, To:123}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>There are also prophesies about the marriage of new Jerusalem.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 62:1-5', Bold: [{From:50, To:60}, {From:628, To:652}, {From:663, To:689}, {From:701, To:719}, {From:733, To:767}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 21:9-10', Bold: [{From:153, To:188}, {From:276, To:305}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Then we have the marriage of Yahshua.</p>
    <p>Can the marriage supper of Yahshua happen before the first resurrection?</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 19:7-9', Bold: [{From:60, To:79}, {From:94, To:101}, {From:331, To:357}, {From:382, To:414}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>As you can see, there is a lot of scripture about marriage that will be forever.</p>

    <h2>Thousand Year Reign</h2>

    <p>We know that here will still be children born in the 1000 year reign, so there will still be some form of marriage.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 65:19-20', Bold: [{From:150, To:273}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>
        Thing about what is going to happen at the end of the 1000 years of peace or even right after the rapture. Let’s say two people are married, if there is no marriage beyond either of these points, there is only two outcomes that I can think of:
        <ol>
            <li>Everyone that is married then just stops loving each other. Sort of like saying: thanks, it was fun, but I don't want you anymore.</li>
            <li>People will still love each other and then Yah says, sorry, you are not allowed to love each other anymore and then separates them.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>If you have spent any time reading the Bible you will agree that both scenarios does not fit what we find in the Bible, especially considering we are commanded to love each other and that Yah is love.</p>

    <h2>In the Beginning</h2>

    <p>From the beginning, in the last verse, also gives us a clue where to look for answers, because in the beginning before the fall, everything was perfect.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 19:3-8', Bold: [{From:184, To:249}, {From:262, To:376}, {From:389, To:425}, {From:443, To:466}, {From:695, To:731}] }"></go-bible-ref>

    <br />
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 2:18', Bold: [{From:14, To:97}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>When Yah said this, Adam was living in heaven with God, speaking with God directly. And Yah still said, "It is not good that the man should be alone".</p>
    <p class="note">
        Something else to keep in mind when we read "from the beginning":
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Ecc 3:14', Bold: [{From:13, To:54}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    </p>

    <h2>The "Contradiction"?</h2>

    <p>I was not able to find a clear answer in Scripture about this seeming contradiction. But if you want to dig future, here are some of the possible places to look:</p>
    <go-accordion params="Title: 'Given in Marriage?'">
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 22:30', Bold: [{From:38, To:43}, {From:53, To:69}], Strongs: [{ Strong: 'G1060', Meaning: ''}, { Strong: 'G1547', Meaning: ''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Luk 20:34-35', Bold: [{From:64, To:69}, {From:78, To:95}, {From:212, To:215}, {From:205, To:210}, {From:216, To:236}], Strongs: [{ Strong: 'G1060', Meaning: ''}, { Strong: 'G1548', Meaning: ''}] }"></go-bible-ref>
        <p>Strongs G1547 and G1548 both show the same "given in marriage" and G1060 also shows that it can mean to "give in marriage". Thought it is never translated that way, and then why would Yahshua say it twice in the same sentence?</p>
        <p>But assuming that this is the case, it shows a clear difference from when Eve was "brought" to Adam.</p>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 2:21-22', Bold: [{From:212, To:236}] }"></go-bible-ref>
        <p>Giving implies ownership and brought unto is more like a union, like two shall become one. But this is just a theory.</p>
    </go-accordion>
    <go-accordion params="Title: 'No Death?'">
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rom 7:2', Bold: [] }"></go-bible-ref>
        <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 7:39', Bold: [] }"></go-bible-ref>
        <p>Marriage in the world today is essentially a contract or agreement that says until death do us part. But after the resurrection we will not die anymore. Maybe it is not called marriage anymore? Keep in mind that there is no record of Adam and Eve getting married, but they were still together. And this was before the fall when there was no death yet.</p>
    </go-accordion>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>We do not get shown what "marriage" is going to look like after the resurrection. But based on Scripture, I'm very sure that marriage type relationships will continue.</p>
