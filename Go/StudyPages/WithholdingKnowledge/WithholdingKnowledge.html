    <h1>Withholding Knowledge</h1>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <p>I have seen a few times now on social media were people ask why God withheld the tree of knowledge from Adan and Eve. Like God wants them to be ignorant and then they make it sound like the snake was the good guy for leading Adam and Even to the tree of knowledge.</p>
    <p>There are 2 problems with this view.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Knowledge</h2>

    <p>The first is that it looks at this specific instance in isolation and ignores the rest of scripture. If we look at the rest of the Bible, there are dozens of passages that shows that God does want us to have knowledge and be wise.</p>
    <p>Here is just a few of them:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Pro 2:6', Bold: [{From:9, To:79}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Ti 2:3-4', Bold: [{From:106, To:141}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 5:13', Bold: [{From:45, To:74}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Hos 4:6', Bold: [{From:14, To:44}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jer 3:15', Bold: [{From:53, To:105}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>As we can see, Yah does want us to have knowledge and not be fools or ignorant. So then why did Yah tell Adam and Eve not to eat of the tree of knowledge?</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Tree of Good and Evil</h2>

    <p>This is where the second problem comes in, they just call is knowledge like it is general information. But it is not just a tree of knowledge, but of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gen 2:17', Bold: [{From:0, To:48}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>The evil part is the key, this isn’t just knowledge, it is also knowledge of evil.</p>
    <p>The Bible does not tell us how long Adam and Eve was in the Garden of Eden or even if they were created physically as full adults. But even if they were created as physical adults, that does not automatically give them spiritual, emotional or mental maturity. Even if they were in the Garden of Eden for 10 years, they would still be considered children.</p>
    <p>To put this another way, why do we have age restrictions on movies today?</p>
    <p>The real question that we should be asking, is why the devil wants to give the knowledge of evil to children.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>They question the motives of God when He withholds the knowledge of evil. Should the motives of the devil not then also be questioned, when he wants to give that same knowledge of evil to those that are not mature enough to handle it?</p>
