    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is not so much an in-depth end-to-end study about the Rapture, but rather a collection of things that I found over the course of trying to understand Revelation. Hopefully it can help someone in their own studies about the Rapture.</p>
    <p>
        Just for some context, I believe the Rapture happens at the end or just past the end of Seal 6 in Revelation. Please see the
        <a href="/tools/revelation-timeline" onclick="go.NavigateLink(event)">Revelation Timeline</a>
        , specifically, Seal 6 and the Rapture sections. Hopefully that can show how the verses and passages fit together to form a bigger picture.

<div class="box">
    <h2>Secret Rapture?</h2>

    <p>Let start by looking at the idea that the rapture will happen in secret or leave everyone wondering about what happened afterwards. A lot of churches and Hollywood love showing the secret rapture where a lot of people just disappear out of the blue and no one knows why, but in Revelation 6 we see a very different story:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 6:13-15', Bold: [{From:0, To:12}, {From:14, To:42}, {From:127, To:161}, {From:191, To:208}, {From:210, To:250}, {From:400, To:459}], Show: GO.eRefTypeShow.Most }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>As you can see, there are a few things that need to happen.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Angels need to fall to Earth (Might be spiritual and not visible as angels are spiritual)</li>
        <li>Heaven will depart as a scroll</li>
        <li>Mountains/Kingdoms will be moved out of their places</li>
        <li>And people will hide in fear</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It would be very hard to imagine how all of this could happen in secret.</p>
    <p>Verse 16 continues to show that people will see Yah when he returns.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 6:16', Bold: [{From:53, To:139}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 24:30', Bold: [{From:4, To:58}, {From:75, To:108}, {From:114, To:201}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>I have included Matthew 24 at this point, because it shows us what happens after Revelation 6 stops. (This connection is easier to see in the Revelation Timeline)</p>
    <p>Specifically, we see that only in verse 31 is the trumpet blown and people gathered:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 24:31', Bold: [{From:4, To:102}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>As you can see, there are multiple things that need to happen before or during the Rapture, and for most of them, it would be very difficult to impossible for it to happen without anyone knowing about it.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Twinkling of an Eye</h2>

    <p>Another common idea fitting with the secret Rapture, is the idea that the Rapture happens in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 15:52', Bold: [{From:0, To:38}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>But this view only works if you isolate this one verse. If we look at the context, it says something different.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 15:51-52', Bold: [{From:54, To:80}, {From:82, To:120}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>Just adding the words of verse 51 changes the meaning entirely. What it is saying, is that we will all be changed "in the twinkling of an eye". Not that the sequence of events shown in Scripture for the Rapture will happen in an instant.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>The Day and the Hour</h2>

    <p>While I’m not trying to determine a specific date for the Rapture, I don’t agree with most churches and believers that the day and hour cannot be known.</p>
    <p>
        Please see the dedicated study about
        <a href="/prophesy-study/NoOneKnowstheDayortheHour" onclick="go.NavigateLink(event)">No One Knows the Day or the Hour?</a>
    </p>
    <p>Instead in this study, we are going to look at the possibility that the Rapture is not a single day event.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Not a One Day Event?</h2>

    <p>Continuing from the secret rapture and in the twinkling of an eye sections above, I don’t think the Rapture happens in one day.</p>
    <p class="warning">
        In this section we will look at an extra Biblical book called Gad the Seer. Even though it is not in the Bible, I do believe it to be inspired text.
        <br />
        But this is something you will have to decide for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>I’m not going to include the whole of chapter 14 just to keep things more focused, but reading all of Gad the Seer is highly recommended. In verse 2 we see "heaven rolled back like a scroll", matching what we see in Revelation 6. This is describing events just before the rapture happens.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gad 14:2', Bold: [{From:30, To:66}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 6:14', Bold: [{From:4, To:61}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>This connection is a bit easier to see in the Revelation Timeline in Seal 6. Admittedly, the argument can also be made that this might be the start of the rapture. I think this happens before the rapture, but whether that will happen hours, days or weeks before I cannot say.</p>
    <p>In verses 7-12 we see what looks like a judgement or at least a filtering process before people are gathered. This makes sense as not everyone will be taken during the Rapture.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gad 14:7-10', Bold: [{From:138, To:147}, {From:216, To:245}, {From:423, To:433}, {From:545, To:608}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>The first group are granted eternal life, so it makes sense that they will be taken in the Rapture.</p>
    <p>The second group is where it gets interesting. Many, me included, believe that the Rapture will happen on the Feast of Trumpets. (Assuming we are following the correct calendar of course.) In verse 10 we see that the ones that are almost ready, are given a 3rd of a month or about 10 days "to see what they will do.".</p>
    <p>The Day of Atonement is on the 10th day of the same month as the Feast of Trumpets.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Lev 16:29-30', Bold: [{From:59, To:154}, {From:258, To:366}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Is the Priest in this context not Yahshua making atonement? This shows the mercy and patience of Yah, giving people that are almost ready but not a 100% there another chance to repent and possibly still make the Rapture. I know this last part of people still making the Rapture 10 days later might seem a bit strange, but Father willing, in the future it will make sense when the study about Seal 7 is complete.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Verses 11-12 show what happens with everyone that is not ready:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Gad 14:11-12', Bold: [{From:16, To:25}, {From:85, To:167}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>We see the why in 1 Corinthians:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 5:5', Bold: [{From:42, To:65}, {From:77, To:95}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>I believe this is the reason for the Tribulation to begin with. The Tribulation is not about punishment but saving everyone possible. If it was just about punishment, then would we not just jump straight to Judgement Day. Why punish people in the Tribulation and then again on Judgement Day?</p>
