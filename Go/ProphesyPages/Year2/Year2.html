    <p>This would place the “take peace from the earth” in the second year of the Revelation Timeline, and it just so happen that this is the period that Trump started causing problems with his tariffs.</p>
    <p>As with Year 1, this is not conclusive. But how many coincidences does it take before it starts making a pattern?</p>
