    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p class="warning">The dates in the timeline as they are shown now, is based on a few assumptions. So please do not take them too seriously. They are simply added in an attempt to better understand Revelation, specifically where we are in the timeline and how long it will be.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Calculation</h2>

    <p>If you look at Trumpet 1, you will see the 1260 days of the 2 witnesses starts at the beginning of Trumpet 1, and then continues until the end of Trumpet 6 (not shown yet). If we divide the 1260 days by the 6 trumpets, we get 210 days per trumpet, or about 7 months. I do not believe we can use this to show the exact start dates of the trumpets, but it should give us an estimated start month and duration for each, give or take a month.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>1st Assumption</h2>
    <p>If the trumpets are 7 months long, then is it not possible that the seals and vials are also 7 months long? There is a reference in the Ascension of Isaiah that talks about another 1317 days period.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'AscIsa 4:12' }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>I have not found the exact location were this will fit into the timeline, so it has not been added here yet, but I do believe it is after the ascension of the 2 witnesses. 1317 days is about 2 months longer than the 1260 days, but it is in the same general ballpark as the 1260 days. If this is indeed after the 1260 days, that would indicate another 3.5+ years for the vials.</p>
    <p>If we assume that all 3 groups (Seals, Trumpets, Vials) are equal, this will give us about 10.5 years if we count the first 6 of each. If we then assume that Seal 7, Trumpet 7, and Vial 7 are also around 7 months each we get a total time of about 12 years.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>2nd Assumption</h2>
    <p>The assumption is that the Biblical beginning of a year must be the start date for the timeline. This assumption aligns the Rapture, Ascension of the 2 Witnesses, and the Day of the Yah with the Feast of Trumpets, or at least in the general area.</p>
    <p class="warning">2023 was the original start date for the timeline and I assumed that the Israel – Gaza war was Seal 2. But then Seal 3 and 4 did not hit. Because of this the timeline was moved forward by 1 year.</p>
    <p>
        With the start date of 2024 there are a few more thing that is aligning. Please see

    <h2>Biblical Years</h2>
    <p>The first line at the top is showing Biblical years or at least years according to the Biblical calendar.</p>
    <p>I know this date can vary depending in what calendar you are using, but as we are only looking for a rough estimate and not to the day specific, this should be within about a month or so of most calendars.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Ba 27:1', Bold: [{From:35, To:51}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Here we see the number 12 come up again. If the tribulation is indeed 12 years long, then each of the 12 parts will represent something that happens in that year, and we can see this with Seal 2.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Ba 27:2', Bold: [{From:7, To:16}, {From:33, To:60}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 6:4', Bold: [{From:91, To:118}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p class="note">Clicking on the years in the <a href="/tools/revelation-timeline" onclick="go.NavigateLink(event)">Revelation Timeline</a> will show the verse for that year in 2 Baruch and any additional information that has been found.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <p>The positioning of the dates is only correct when the tabs are closed. The dates for each tab will not move when the tab is open as there is no direct correlation between the dates and the verses inside of each tab.</p>
    <p>The verses in the tabs can show a lot of details for something that happens in a month but then only show a verse or 2 for something that happens over the next 5 or 6 months. Remember, these are general estimates only.</p>
