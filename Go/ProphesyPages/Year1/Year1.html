    <p class="external">"On 19 May 2024, an Iranian Air Force helicopter crashed near the village of Uzi, East Azerbaijan, Iran, killing President of Iran Ebrahim Raisi" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Varzaqan_helicopter_crash" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>

    <p>Iran has two rulers, a Supreme Leader and a President. Their president died in a helicopter crash in May 2024, “This led to First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber becoming the acting president”.  Then a new president was elected.</p>
    <p>If we include the acting President, then we have the four kings in verse two. If we do not count the acting President, then we still match the first part of verse two with three kings.</p>
    <br />
    <p>In verse one we see that Daniel was shown a vision in the first year. I do not believe this to be a coincidence as there are several times in the Bible that it is recorded when the prophets saw the visions. Assuming the start year for the Revelation Timeline is correct, this matches with the first year of the tribulation as verse two happened in the first Biblical year of the timeline.</p>
    <p>This alone is not much proof, but there is also a match for Year 2, and given current world events, we are heading for a match in Year 3 as well.</p>
