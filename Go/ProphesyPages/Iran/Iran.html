    <h1>Iran in Prophesy</h1>

    <h2>Who is Iran in the Bible</h2>
    <p>The name Iran is not in the Bible, but according to Wikipedia, Iran is also known as Persia.</p>
    <p class="external">
        "Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI), also known as Persia, is a country in West Asia"
        - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <p>If we start looking for Persia in the Bible, we do find prophesies that matches Iran.</p>
    <br />

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Dan 8:3', Bold: [{From:81, To:83}, {From:95, To:103}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Later in chapter 8 with the explanation we see who the ram is:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Dan 8:19-20', Bold: [{From:169, To:211}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />

    <p>Something that I did not know about Iran, is that they have two rulers. A Supreme Leader and a President. This matches what we read in Dan 8:20 about the two kings.</p>
    <p class="external">
        "The Supreme Leader, "Rahbar", Leader of the Revolution or Supreme Leadership Authority, is head of state and responsible for supervision of policy. The president has limited power compared to the Rahbar."
        - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran#Government_and_politics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <p>This looks to match Iran, and if we look at prophesy it becomes more clear.</p>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Prophesy</h2>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Dan 8:4', Bold: [{From:10, To:12}, {From:22, To:29}, {From:36, To:44}, {From:51, To:59}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>
        <b><go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H3220', Alt: ''}">Westward</go-strongs></b>
        is more often translated as “sea” or "west". So, what if we read this as the ram, pushing <b>from</b> the "sea" or the "west"? Gaza or Hamas an Iranian proxy / ally is to the west of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H6828', Alt: ''}">Northward</go-strongs></b>
        is more often translated as "north". And to the north of Israel is Hezbollah in Lebanon, another Iranian proxy / ally.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H5045', Alt: ''}">Southward</go-strongs></b>
        is more often translated as "south". To the south of Israel is the Houthis in Yemen.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>In all three cases, the word difference is not major, but it is enough to change the meaning from always pushing in a direction to potentially also meaning pushing from that direction.</p>
    <p>These are things we see happening in the world today, and later during the explanation in Daniel 8, we see that this is indeed an end time prophesy.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Dan 8:16-17', Bold: [{From:86, To:123}, {From:232, To:303}] }"></go-bible-ref>

</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>We do also see further in Daniel what is going to happen.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Dan 8:5-8', Bold: [{From:50, To:62}, {From:100, To:121}, {From:284, To:300}, {From:387, To:424}, {From:482, To:515}, {From:540, To:600}, {From:645, To:690}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Someone from the west is going to attack Iran and win, but then they will also be broken.</p>
    <p>In the explanation of Daniel 8 we see when the great horn is broken, his nation will be broken into four kingdoms.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Dan 8:21-22', Bold: [{From:14, To:39}, {From:157, To:202}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>Yah willing, more details will be added here as we see events in the world unfolding.</p>
