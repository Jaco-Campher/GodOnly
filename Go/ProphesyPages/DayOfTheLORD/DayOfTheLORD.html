    <h2>Day of Salvation?</h2>

    <p>Most people believe that the Day of the Yah refers to the rapture or day of salvation. But looking at some of the verses below, we don’t see light and salvation, instead we see something entirely different.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 13:6', Bold: [{From:17, To:32}, {From:64, To:93}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Amo 5:18', Bold: [{From:0, To:43}, {From:73, To:118}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Oba 1:15', Bold: [{From:8, To:51}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>This is describing a day of wrath and in Zaphaniah we see a very detailed description of this.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Zep 1:14-18', Bold: [{From:10, To:24}, {From:10, To:24}, {From:128, To:145}, {From:161, To:172}, {From:177, To:203}, {From:208, To:238}, {From:243, To:272}, {From:277, To:308}, {From:323, To:339}, {From:413, To:429}, {From:516, To:554}, {From:658, To:680}, {From:711, To:746}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>As you can see, this is not describing a good day or a day to look forward to and there are many more verses showing the same thing further down under Other Verses.</p>

    <h2>Day of the Lord Jesus</h2>
    <p>There are only two verses that is somewhat different where we find salvation and rejoicing and in both cases the name of Yahshua is also present.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Co 5:5', Bold: [{From:3, To:32}, {From:42, To:65}, {From:77, To:82}, {From:91, To:95}, {From:104, To:124}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Co 1:14', Bold: [{From:58, To:66}, {From:101, To:121}] }"></go-bible-ref>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>When is the Day of the Lord?</h2>
    <p>Don’t worry, I’m not going to set a date. But we can find where this is in the sequence of events in Revelation. The Day of the Yah is described as coming as a thief:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Th 5:2-3', Bold: [{From:39, To:53}, {From:58, To:74}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '2Pe 3:10', Bold: [{From:8, To:22}, {From:29, To:43}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>In Revelation between vial 6 and 7 we find another reference about coming as a thief:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 16:15', Bold: [{From:10, To:24}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>The Day of the Yah happening with the vials fits with the overall theme about wrath and destruction we have seen in the other verses.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 16:1', Bold: [{From:103, To:127}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 13:9', Bold: [{From:12, To:26}, {From:36, To:73}, {From:87, To:99}] }"></go-bible-ref>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Other Verses</h2>
    <p>All the other verses about the Day of the Yah shows the same wrath, anger and destruction.</p>
