    <h2>White Horse</h2>
    <p>The only other white horse rider in Scripture is from Revelation 19:11-16, and here we can see that the white horse rider is Yahshua:</p>

    <p>We can see from the below verses that the bow is a covenant:</p>

    <h2>Conquering and to Conquer</h2>
    <p>This is the part that I have never found any additional information for. Is this conquering one of the heavens or maybe the conquering in the spiritual realm? The passage in revelation does not seem to give any indication that this is happening on earth, like some of the other seals do.</p>
    <p>We know that Yahshua is going to conquer earth, but that only happens at the end of Vial 6, and that is very far away from Seal 1.</p>
    <p>Given this limited information, I don’t believe we can know for certain when Seal 1 is opened, so we will have to look at Seal 2, 3 and 4 for an indication of where we are in the timeline.</p>
