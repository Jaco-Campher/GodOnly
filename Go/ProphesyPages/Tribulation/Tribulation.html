        As most believers, for most of my life I believed that the word tribulation in the Bible meant the end times or the "Tribulation Period". But the word translated as "Tribulation" is Strong number
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'G2347', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        in the New Testament and is also translated as “Affliction” and “Trouble”. In the Old Testament it is
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H6862', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        and
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'H6869', Alt: ''}"></go-strongs>
        , and both are more often translated a “Trouble”.
    </p>
    <p>Now this alone does not prove anything, but if we take a closer look at how the word is used in Scripture, we see that it is not always used to describe the end times.</p>

    <p>Here John is saying that he is in tribulation, but John wrote this almost 2000 years ago. How can John be in tribulation 2000 years before the "Tribulation Period" of the end times?</p>

    <p>Here Yahshua is saying that the church in Smyrna is in tribulation, again, almost 2000 years ago.</p>
    <br />
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jhn 16:33', Bold: [{From:69, To:107}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <p>When Yahshua was speaking to His disciples, and He tells them that they will have tribulation in the world. Again, they lived almost 2000 years ago.</p>

    <p>We use the word tribulation to describe the end times. When we say tribulation, everyone knows what we are talking about. But just because we use the word that way, does no mean the Bible does as well. When the word is used in the Bible, it is "Trouble" or "Affliction" and not necessarily the end times.</p>
