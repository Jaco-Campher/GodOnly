        "as much as would support a man of moderate appetite for a day".<br />
        <br />
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'G1220', Alt: ''}">Penny</go-strongs>
        seems to be a daily wage according to the parable that Yahshua gave in Matthew 20.

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 20:2', Bold: [{From:13, To:45}, {From:47, To:53}, {From:54, To:60}], Strongs: [{Strong:'G1220', Meaning:''}] }"></go-bible-ref>

    <p>This would mean that a daily wage is just enough to buy food for that day. Now these are day workers mentioned in Matthew 20, and likely people that work for minimum wage. People with higher levels of income will not be affected in the same way, and minimum wage can vary greatly from country to country. This makes it very difficult to measure when we are at the levels needed to match Seal 3.</p>
    <p>There are a few ways that this can happen or maybe more likely it will be a combination of different things.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Shortage of Food</h2>
    <p>This is how I always assumed Seal 3 would happen, but looking at what is happening in the world today, inflation and a lack of income seems more likely.</p>
    <p class="warning">
        That being said, I still believe there will be a shortage a food in the future as Seal 4 lists
        <go-strongs params="{ Strongs: 'G3042', Alt: 'famine'}">hunger</go-strongs>
        as one of the ways in which people are killed. Having a reserve of food and other essentials is highly recommended.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>High Food Prices or Inflation</h2>
    <p>Inflation and food prices have been going up over the last few years now, but I don’t think it has reached the level needed to say that we have reached Seal 3 yet. But it is possible that it is only one of the factors that will cause high food prices.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Lack of Income or a Recession</h2>
    <p>Given the current events in the world, this seems to be the most likely. A pair of balances is mentioned in Seal 3, and if we look at other places in scripture, balances are linked to trading.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Isa 46:6', Bold: [{From:37, To:63}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Hos 12:7', Bold: [{From:7, To:56}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Amo 8:5', Bold: [{From:40, To:60}, {From:92, To:130}, {From:137, To:152}, {From:159, To:191}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>There are not many verses in the Bible that talks about a balance or balances in a positive light.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Upcoming Recession</h2>
    <p>We have not officially hit a recission yet, but if we look at everything going on in the world like high inflation, trade wars, actual wars, and massive debt, it looks almost inevitable at this point.</p>
