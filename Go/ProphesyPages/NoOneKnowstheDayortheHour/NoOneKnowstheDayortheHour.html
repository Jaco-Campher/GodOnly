    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Most churches and believers believe that the day and hour of Yahshua’s return cannot be known. They normally quote verses like Mat 24:36, Mat 24:42, or Mrk 13:32. In this study we will look at each of these and a few more.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>But of that Day and Hour Knoweth No Man?</h2>

    <p>Let’s start with Matthew and Mark:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 24:36', Bold: [{From:0, To:38}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mrk 13:32', Bold: [{From:0, To:43}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>Most believers just assume that this is talking about the Rapture. But if we look at the context for each of these verses, we begin to see a different picture.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 24:35-36', Bold: [{From:0, To:32}, {From:68, To:106}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>If we look at the verse before, we see that Yahshua is talking about when heaven and earth will pass away. In Mark we see the same thing:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mrk 13:31-32', Bold: [{From:0, To:32}, {From:68, To:111}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>In Revelation, we see that the time when heaven and earth pass away is at the end of Revelation and at the end of the 1000 years of peace.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Rev 21:1-4', Bold: [{From:40, To:96}, {From:504, To:640}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>Yahshua was not talking about the Rapture, but about the end of the 1000 years of peace.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>But as the Days of Noah?</h2>

    <p>Now if we look at the same verse in Matthew again, but this time we look at the verses following it, we see the following:</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 24:36-39', Bold: [{From:0, To:38}, {From:91, To:112}, {From:138, To:164}, {From:322, To:378}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br />
    <p>If we look at verse 39, we can see that this is not those that are saved that are taken away, but rather those that are not saved. During Noah’s flood, only 8 were left on earth and the rest was destroyed. The flood does not describe salvation, but destruction.</p>
    <p>The saved being left does not fit the Rapture, nor does it fit the ascension of the 2 witnesses as in both cases, those that are ready are the ones that are taken away and everyone who is not has to stay longer.</p>
    <p>
        What seems to fit best for this is the day of Yah, or the day of destruction, this will be the 3rd time that Yahshua comes back, not the 1st. Just to be clear “The day of the Lord” is not the Rapture. Please see a study about
        <a href="/prophesy-study/dayofthelord" onclick="go.NavigateLink(event)">The Day of the Lord</a>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>In Joel 2 we can see that people are still called to repentance even after the day of wrath. This fits with the days of Noah, as those that repent will not be destroyed. This also shows the great mercy that Yah has for people, to show mercy even during destruction.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Jol 2:11-14', Bold: [{From:123, To:172}, {From:330, To:433}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>We can go much deeper with what will happen during and after the day of destruction, but it is outside the scope of the current study.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Cometh as a Thief in the Night</h2>

    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 24:42-44', Bold: [{From:17, To:61}, {From:122, To:155}, {From:264, To:320}] }"></go-bible-ref>

    <p>Another passage that is often quoted for the Rapture, but note that it does not give us any information that says it is talking about the Rapture. Instead, we have to match it to other verses to see where in the end times this is referring to.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: '1Th 5:2-3', Bold: [{From:39, To:53}, {From:65, To:87}, {From:137, To:171}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>
        In 1 Thessalonians we see another reference for coming as a thief in the night, but it is talking about the Day of the Lord and sudden destruction and not the Rapture. As mentioned earlier in the study “The day of the Lord” is not the Rapture. Please see the study about
        <a href="/prophesy-study/dayofthelord" onclick="go.NavigateLink(event)">The Day of the Lord</a>.
    </p>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Parable of the 10 Virgins</h2>

    <p>I’m not going to include the whole parable (Mat 25:1-13) here, only the end in verse 13 as that is the part that relates to this study.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mat 25:13', Bold: [{From:18, To:87}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>Even when looking at this verse in context does not change its meaning. This is the only reference I have seen so far that shows the day and hour will not be known. But then, we only need one.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Please keep in mind that while we do have at least one reference to show that the day and hour is not known, it cannot be true forever, only for a time.</p>
    <p>If the rapture happens tomorrow, will we know the day and hour? When someone is born in the 1000 years of peace, will they know the day and hour the Rapture happened? Of course, from their perspective it is in the past.</p>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Mrk 4:22', Bold: [{From:5, To:55}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <go-bible-ref params="{ Ref: 'Amo 3:7', Bold: [{From:0, To:94}] }"></go-bible-ref>
    <br/>
    <p>I do believe somewhere in the prophecies in Scripture is the information to know the day of the Rapture. At some point in the future the date will be known or at least the start date. The only question is, will it be known before or after the Rapture happens.</p>
    <p>
        Personally, I believe the rapture is not a single day event, but rather something that happens over 10 or more days. Please see the study about the
